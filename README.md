Performing Linear Regression using Batch Gradient Descent in R

The objective of this project is to perform linear regression using batch gradient descent manually. Applying iterative batch gradient descent to the house price dataset. The dataset has following columns - house area, the number of bedrooms and price.

Creating a function that takes input as - predictor variables as a data frame, response variable, no. of iterations and alpha (learning rate) and returns theta (coefficients of variables) and Jtheta (cost of each iteration)

Creating a plot to view the cost of each iteration against its coefficients i.e. Jtheta vs theta.
